# Bookmark Manager

Bookmarks are annotated, tagged references to articles or tweets. Bookmarks are submitted to Presterity by volunteers or interested citizens, and, once reviewed and approved, are automatically used to populate the Timeline section of the topic pages on [presterity.org](https://presterity.org/).
